# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

E-Commerce is the platform of choice for the electronics industry. Having a way to sell your goods online is the best way to position your business for success.

With this E-Commerce Back End, you'll have everything you need on the server-side to get started. You'll be able to create categories to organize your goods, create tags to display products that have aspects in common, and you can create your products, of course. You can test your information with an API platform like Insomnia or Postman.
